## Unicorns Fart Pixels redesign

UFP was originally hosted created with Jekyll and on Github Pages, but over time Jekyll has proved to be slow and really frustrating. Github Pages is a great free option, but caching issues got in the way of updates as well to the point that maintaining the blog became more pain than pleasure. Which kindaaaa defeats the purpose of a blog about fun code experiments!

Enter Hugo, which has turned out to be just what I needed in terms of speed and bonus: it's a pleasure to use. Thanks to [Sara Soueidan's](https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan) thorough [overview](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/jekyll-ghpages-to-hugo-netlify/) of her own experience with Netlify, I decided to try it out, and have no regrets.
