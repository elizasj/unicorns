#### Questions, comments & [constructive] critiques are welcome

...which might surprise some, who may have noticed that this space is free of a comments section. That decision was made to honor the notebook/written-in-pencil spirit of <a href="http://www.unicornsfartpixels.com/about/">UFP</a>. 

However, the spirit of the Internet also carries some weight with me, so please feel free to direct any and all pertinent notes or ideas my way, via <a href="https://twitter.com/iamelizasj">__twitter__</a> or  if you should feel so inclined as to type out more than ~~140~~, er, I mean <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/28/twitter-users-respond-to-280-character-limit-mostly-in-140-characters" target="_blank">280 chars</a>, send along an <a href="mailto:unicornsfartpixelsblog@gmail.com">__email__</a>.
